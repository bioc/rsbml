To build rsbml on Windows, please download and unpack libsbml 5.10.0
and point to the extracted directory with the LIBSBML_PATH environment
variable. It might work with some other versions, but we have only
really tested 5.10.0.

To build rsbml on the Mac, first install libsbml with:
`brew install homebrew/science/libsbml`.
